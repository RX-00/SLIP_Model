function dy = SLIP_Stance(t, q, s)
% SLIP_Stance attempt at a passive SLIP model by Roy X.
% Find (x, y) of the point mass!
% This is the stance phase
% s stands for the struct of all the parameters
%
% q = [ x, x dot, y, y dot, ft pos, phase]
% NOTE: changed the y state vector name to q just for clarity
% Thus, in order to define x and y you must do
% x = y(:,1), y = y(:,3)
    
    x = q(1);
    y = q(3);
    
    xtd = q(5);
    ytd = 0;
